# 1. What is a proxy object?

A **Proxy** object wraps another object and intercepts operations, like reading/writing properties and others, optionally handling them on its own, or transparently allowing the object to handle them.

```js
const handler = {
  get(target, prop) {
    // ...
  }
  set(target, prop, val) {
    // ...
  }
}

let proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
```

# 2. How do you create an object with prototype?

- Object Literal
- Object.create(Object_prototype)
- Constructor (function constructor or class)
- \_proto\_

# 3. What is the difference between proto and prototype?

| The prototype property is set to function when it is declared. All the functions have a prototype property.                               | proto property that is set to an object when it is created using a new keyword. All objects behavior newly created have proto properties. |

# 4. How do you define JSON arrays?

A JSON array contains zero, one, or more ordered elements, separated by a comma. The JSON array is surrounded by square brackets [ ].

Data types are allowed for JSON arrays:

- string (" ")
- number
- float
- JSON array (can be nested)
- JSON object
- boolean true or false
- null

# 5. What is tree shaking?

**Tree shaking** is a method of optimising code bundles by eliminating any code from the final file that isnâ€™t actually being used.
