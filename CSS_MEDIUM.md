# 1. What are the css selectors?

**CSS selectors** define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.

- _Type of selectors:_

  - Universal selector (\*)
  - Type selector
  - Class selector
  - ID selector
  - Attribute selector
  - Pseudo

- _Operations with selectors:_

  - Grouping (with ",")
  - Combinators (" ", ">", "~", "+")

# 2. What is the difference between Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?

**A pseudo-class** is a selector that selects elements that are in a _specific state_, e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer.

**Pseudo-elements** behave in a similar way. However, they act as if you had added a whole _new HTML element_ into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
