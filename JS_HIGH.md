# 1. What are primitive data types?

Primitive data types:

- number (integer or floating-point)
  Integers limitation Â±(253-1)
- bigint (for integers outside the limits)
- string
- boolean (true,false)
- null
- undefined (unassigned values)
- symbol (unique identifiers)

_Main feature_: after declare they are stored on a _stack_ and assigned to variables by _value_, not by reference
